## `getBlockDetailsByBlockHashXRP()`

```php
getBlockDetailsByBlockHashXRP($network, $blockHash, $context): \CryptoapisApiClient\Model\GetBlockDetailsByBlockHashXRPR
```

Get Block Details By Block Hash XRP

Through this endpoint customers can obtain basic information about a given XRP block (a block on the XRP blockchain), specifically by using the `hash` parameter. These block details could include the hash of the specific, the previous and the next block, the number of included transactions, etc.     Since XRP is a different blockchain than Bitcoin and Ethereum, it isn't unified.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
$config = CryptoapisApiClient\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKey('x-api-key', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
// Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
// $config = CryptoapisApiClient\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKeyPrefix('x-api-key', 'Bearer');


$apiInstance = new CryptoapisApiClient\Api\BlocksXRPApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$network = testnet; // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while network like \"testnet\" is a test network.
$blockHash = 1ab0614d2a438da8b23086cbceef7d443edbd295d9c7619fc8a19c7618bc22c9; // string | Represents the hash of the block, which is its unique identifier. It represents a cryptographic digital fingerprint made by hashing the block header twice through the SHA256 algorithm.
$context = yourExampleString; // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->getBlockDetailsByBlockHashXRP($network, $blockHash, $context);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling BlocksXRPApi->getBlockDetailsByBlockHashXRP: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
