# # GetBlockDetailsByBlockHeightEVMRI

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**extraData** | **string** | Represents any data that can be included by the miner in the block. |
**gasLimit** | **int** | Numeric representation of the block gas limit |
**gasUsed** | **int** | Numeric representation of the block gas used |
**hash** | **string** | Represents the hash of the block, which is its unique identifier. It represents a cryptographic digital fingerprint made by hashing the block header twice through the SHA256 algorithm. |
**height** | **int** | Represents the number of blocks in the blockchain preceding this specific block. Block numbers have no gaps. A blockchain usually starts with block 0 called the \&quot;Genesis block\&quot;. |
**minedInSeconds** | **int** | Numeric representation of the block gas limit |
**nextBlockHash** | **string** | Representation of the next block hash. | [optional]
**nonce** | **int** | Numeric representation of the block nonce |
**previousBlockHash** | **string** | Represents the hash of the previous block, also known as the parent block. |
**size** | **int** | Numeric representation of the block size |
**timestamp** | **int** | Defines the exact date/time when this block was mined in Unix Timestamp. |
**totalDifficulty** | **int** | Numeric representation of the block total difficulty |
**transactionsCount** | **int** | Represents the total number of all transactions as part of this block. |
